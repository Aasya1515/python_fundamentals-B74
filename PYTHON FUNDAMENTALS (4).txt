                                                                                            PYTHON FUNDAMENTALS
DAY 1 CLASS.  :
     Softwares Needed:
       1.www.anaconda.com (jupyter notebook)
        2.www.github.com   (code versioning system)
STEPS TO BE FOLLOWED TO DOWNLOAD ANACONDA.COM
1. Open www.anaconda.com
2.choose the download option available on the screen.
3.Go to downloads and run the .exe file ------.next------.next------.next ----->anaconda will be installed in  your system.
4.It will be creating a shortcut on your desktop called as "Anaconda navigator"
5.open the anaconda navigator----->choose " Jupyternotebook"----->click on launch.
6.It will be opening up in your browser.
7.To the right side of the screen click on the "new" which is beside "upload". Then click on python 3(ipykernel).


 print("Hello World").  #this is the input=====>shift+enter button
 Hello World

STEPE TO BE FOLLOWED TO GET GITHUB :
1.Open. www.github.com
2.Create your account by doing the signup
3.login to github
4.create a repository (python fundamentals)
5.Upload your code file in to the repo
6.commit the code.


DAY 2 CLASS  :
  RULES FOR DECLARING THE VARIABLES IN PYTHON. :
  
 RULE 1 : No Namespaces while declaring the variable in python.
     first name = 'Chandana'
     print(first name)
   you will get SYNTAXERROR as you gave space between first and name.


   firstname = 'Chandana'
   print(firstname)
  Chandana.         ( THIS IS RIGHT )

   first_name = 'chandana'
   print(first_name)
   chandana.  (THIS IS RIGHT)



   RULE 2  :A variable name should not start with a number 

   1name  = 'chandana'
   print(1name)
  you will get SYNTAXERROR as you stared with number in 1name

  name1 = 'chandana'
 print(name1)
 chandana.  (THIS IS RIGHT)



  RULE 3 : A variable name should not contain any special characters.(@#$%)

   name@ = 'chandana'
  print(name@)
  you will get SYNTAXERROR as you put a special character.

  INTRODUCTION TO DATA TYPES IN PYTHON. :
        1.Strings =====>str
         2.lists =====> list
        3.Numbers ------>integers. (int) and float (decimals)
        4.tuples --------->tuple
        5.Dictionaries ----------> dict 

   CLASSIFICATION OF DATATYPES :
  Broadly data types are classified into two catogories :
  1.mutable types ------>which we can edit or alter----->flexible in nature.
  2.immutable datatypes -----> which we cannot edit or alter ------> fixed in nature.


   Intoduction to string datatype. :
   Definition: A string is series of characters declared in quotes.
   Classification : It is classified as an immutable datatype.
   How to declare the string data type-----?
  You can declare string datatype by 2 approaches.
  1. single quote
  2. double quote.

   name = 'chandana' #single quote.
   print(name)
   chandana

  name2 = "chandana" #double quote.
  print(name2)
  chandana


   INTRODUCTION TO STRING METHODS :
   Methods are nothing but builtin programs that are available in python to use directly.
   type(name)
   str

   type(name2)
   str

  fullname = 'sri chandana'
  print(fullname)
  sri chandana

  #required to get in the right format:

   print(fullname.title())
   Sri Chandana.  (CHANGED THE TITLE WITH CAPITALS HERE)

   # REQUIRED TO GET THE NAME IN CAPITAL LETTERS :
     print(fullname.upper())
    SRI CHANDANA.   (HERE IT CHANGED TO ALL CAPITAL LETTERS)

    # REQUIRED TO GET THE NAME IN LOWER CASE :

     print(fullname.lower())
     sri chandana. (HERE IT CHANGED TO ALL LOWER CASE)


     DAY 3 CLASS :
    Continuation with string datatype.

    first_name = 'sri chandana'
    last_name = 'singam reddy'

   #  REQ :I want to get the full name.
   understanding the concepts of string. :
   #  general syntax of f strings
    f "custom words {place_holder -1} {place_holder-2}--------- {place_holder- n}"
    full_name = f "{first_name} {last_name}"
    print(full_name)
   sri chandana singam reddy
